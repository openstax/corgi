<para id="fs-idm335689392">The FTC was created in 1914 to address the problem of monopolies and trusts. Following the Civil War, a wave of consolidation and growth among companies triggered increased public debate. Through handshake agreements, issuance of stock, and pooling arrangements, companies could fix prices and outputs, thus effectively stopping competition and raising consumer prices. A substantial number of mergers gave control over key industries to small groups of businesses. Where companies did not merge, other arrangements were made to have a similar effect. Conglomerates controlled most of the relevant industries that produced household necessities. Goods used in production were also the product of highly concentrated trusts, such as the United States Steel Corporation and the International Paper Company. Concerns about industrialization and a changing economy, with shifting norms for personal lives, triggered antitrust sentiment.</para>

These organizations posed economic and social problems that became a large social concern. In response, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created with broad powers to investigate and propose formal recommendations to companies about their competitive practices. The FTC did not formally have a consumer protection mission until the passage of the Wheeler-Lea Act in 1938. This act gave the FTC the power to combat false advertising for any foods, drugs, medical devices, or cosmetics.</para>
<para id="fs-idm321280592">In addition to the Wheeler-Lea Act, subsequent amendments to the FTC Act, as well as judicial respect toward the agency, broadened the power and jurisdiction of the FTC.</para>
<para id="fs-idm334395152">Today, in addition to its original antitrust roots, the FTC enforces consumer protection laws.</para>
