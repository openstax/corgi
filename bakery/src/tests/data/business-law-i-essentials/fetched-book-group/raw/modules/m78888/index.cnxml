<para id="fs-idm316192256">The Bill of Rights is the common term given to the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These are not the only set of amendments to the Constitution, but they are considered together as impacting rights because they limit the ability of the federal government to infringe upon individual freedoms. In addition, a later amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, extends the provisions set out in the Bill of Rights to the states, in addition to federal government. The Bill of Rights has a substantial impact upon government regulation of commercial activity, and therefore, it is important to fully understand it.</para>

<title>Application of the Bill of Rights to Commercial Activity</title>
<para id="fs-idm341711424">The protections afforded the citizenry in the Bill of Rights are also extended to corporations and commercial activities. In the next sections, some applications of the various amendments in the area of business are discussed.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm357151840">
<title>The First Amendment</title>
<para id="fs-idm345929184">The freedom of speech provisions in the First Amendment have application to corporations. The courts distinguish between different types of speech, and each has implications for the power of the federal government and states to regulate in these areas:</para>
<list id="fs-idm335551968" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item><term>Corporate Political Speech. </term>Political speech is any speech used to support political agendas or candidates. Until the 1970s, several states prevented firms from financially supporting political advertising because they feared the power of corporate assets. However, since the 1978 case <term>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</term>, it has been established that corporate political speech is protected in the same way as citizens’ free speech.</item>
  <item><term>Unprotected Speech. </term>The 1942 case <term>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</term> determined that certain types of speech—that which could “inflict injury or incite an immediate breach of the peace”—is not protected under the First Amendment. Therefore, obscenities, defamation, and slanderous speech are not protected.</item>
  <item><term>Commercial Speech.</term> This type of speech conveys information pertaining to the sale of goods and services. Ever since the 1980 case <term>Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp v. Public Service Commission of New York</term>, a four-part test has been established to determine whether commercial speech should be regulated according to the First Amendment. This test is known as The <term>Central Hudson Test for Commercial Speech.</term></item>
</list><figure id="fs-idm334237536"><media id="fs-idm335570160" alt="The image depicts a decision tree composed of Question boxes connected by binary determinations of Yes and No.  The end-points of each pathway in the tree lead to two destinations, which are as follows:  “Speech is not protected by the First Amendment,” or “Speech is protected by the First Amendment.”    The tree flows as follows: “Does the speech concern an illegal activity?  Is it misleading?”  If yes, “Speech is not protected by the first amendment.”  If no, a new question is presented, reading, “Is substantial government interest served by the restriction on commercial speech?”  If no, the end point is that the speech is protected by the First Amendment.    If the question regarding substantial government interest being served by the restriction is yes, the subsequent question reads, “Does the regulation directly advance the government interest asserted?”  If no, the speech is protected by the First Amendment.  If yes, the final question in this pathway reads, “Is the regulation more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest?”  If yes, the speech is protected by the First Amendment.  If no, the speech is not protected by the First Amendment. "><image src="../resources/c9a6a5d2a64d32a522a9ea21b3255a2b387df82c" mime-type="image/png"/></media>

Issues pertaining to this clause often arise in organizational settings. For example, historically, there have been a number of cases in which government employees have challenged employers’ attempts to inhibit their exercise of religious practice (e.g., the wearing of religious symbols) in the workplace.</para>

<title>The Fourth Amendment</title>
<para id="fs-idm333640912">The Fourth Amendment guarantees that citizens are free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and requires government officials to obtain <term>search warrants</term> to conduct searches. However, government officials can only request a search warrant if they have <term>probable cause</term> to believe that criminal activity is occurring at the location of the search, or that they will locate evidence of criminal activity during the search (except where the official believes items will be removed prior to obtaining a warrant). The Fourth Amendment protects individual organizations and places of business, as well as residences. However, under the terms of the <term>pervasive-regulation exception, </term>administrative agencies can conduct warrantless searches of businesses attached to industries that have a long history of pervasive regulation. For example, public health agencies are allowed to conduct warrantless searches of stone quarries, as authorized by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.</para>

<title>The Fifth Amendment</title>
<para id="fs-idm333065920">For commercial enterprises and businesspeople, it is the <term>due process clause</term> of the Fifth Amendment that offers the most extensive protection. The clause states that the government cannot take an individual’s life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Specifically, there are two types of due process:</para>
<list id="fs-idm354121840">
  <item><term>Substantive due process</term> means that laws that will deprive an individual of his or her life, liberty, or property must be fair and not arbitrary. Laws passed should not affect fundamental rights, and regulations are required to meet the <term>rational-basis test.</term> In other words, the government must demonstrate that the law bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. Many regulations affecting commercial activity, such as banking regulations, minimum wage laws, and regulations inhibiting unfair trade, have been tested against the rational-basis test.</item>
  <item><term>Procedural due process </term>means that governments must use fair procedures when depriving an individual of his or her life, liberty, or property. This status quo does not only apply to federal criminal proceedings. For example, if a government employer discharges an employee from his job, or if the government suspends the driver’s license of a worker, the employer must follow procedural due process.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm331462880">Another clause contained in the Fifth Amendment that is relevant to commercial enterprises is the <term>takings clause. </term>According to this clause, when the government seizes private property for public use, it is required that the government pay the owner <term>just compensation</term> for the property. Just compensation is understood to be equivalent to the market value of the property. This clause has been broadly interpreted. For example, if environmental or safety regulations significantly impact the way in which a property owner can use his or her land for economic gain, the regulation can essentially be deemed as depriving the owner of his or her land, and the owner is entitled to compensation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm339750416">It is important to note that the <term>privilege against self-incrimination</term>, established under the Fifth Amendment (usually interpreted as the right to remain silent), only applies to sole proprietorships that are not legally distinct from the individual who owns them. Custodians and agents of corporations do not enjoy this privilege.</para>
